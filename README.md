# Optimal Control
My  study corner for [CMU 16.745 Optimal Control](https://optimalcontrol.ri.cmu.edu/) by prof.Zachary Manchester.It's a excellent course.I've leraned a lot form this course

## course description
This is a course about how to make robots move through and interact with their environment with speed, efficiency, and robustness. We will survey a broad range of topics from nonlinear dynamics, linear systems theory, classical optimal control, numerical optimization, state estimation, system identification, and reinforcement learning. The goal is to provide students with hands-on experience applying each of these ideas to a variety of robotic systems so that they can use them in their own research.
